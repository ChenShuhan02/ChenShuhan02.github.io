### 1. [Data Analysis and Mining of User Behavior on E-Commerce Platforms](#)

- **üë§ Author**: Shuhan Chen  
- **üè´ Affiliation**: School of AI and Advanced Computing, Xi'an Jiaotong-Liverpool University  
- **üìú Abstract**:  
  The burgeoning e-commerce sector requires in-depth understanding of user behavior to improve marketing strategies and customer experiences. This research analyzes user behavior on e-commerce platforms using statistical modeling, clustering, and artificial neural networks, revealing temporal and geographical purchasing patterns. These insights provide a foundation for predictive models that can forecast consumer actions, helping businesses to better tailor their marketing and engagement strategies.
- **üè∑Ô∏è Keywords**: Data analysis, E-commerce, Statistical modeling, Clustering  

#### üîç Research Highlights
- **Advanced Machine Learning Techniques**: Applied K-means clustering, hierarchical clustering, and artificial neural networks to segment users and identify behavior patterns.
- **Behavioral Insights**: Identified trends in user purchasing behavior over **time, location,** and **quantity**. Key insights included:
  - Sales peaked during **holiday seasons** (January, June, Valentine's Day).
  - Consumer purchasing activity showed significant variations during different parts of the day.
