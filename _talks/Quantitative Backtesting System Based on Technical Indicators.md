**Author**: Shuhan Chen  
**Date**: 2024  
**Project Type**: Quantitative Trading System  
**Focus**: Backtesting and Evaluating Trading Strategies using Technical Indicators

#### üìú Overview
The **Quantitative Backtesting System Based on Technical Indicators** is a modular framework designed to help traders evaluate the performance of trading strategies using a combination of popular technical indicators and historical market data. The goal of this system is to provide a practical tool for **optimizing trading strategies** through **backtesting**.

#### üîó Links
- **GitHub Repository**: [Quantitative Backtesting System](https://github.com/ChenShuhan02/Quantitative-Backtesting-System-Based-on-Technical-Indicators)

#### üîë Key Highlights
- **Technical Indicators**: Supports multiple technical indicators, including **Moving Average (MA)**, **Relative Strength Index (RSI)**, **Bollinger Bands**, and **MACD**.
- **Customizable Strategies**: Allows users to create custom trading strategies by combining different indicators.
- **Backtesting Module**: Provides simulation capabilities using historical data to test and evaluate the defined strategies.
- **Performance Metrics**: The system calculates various performance metrics such as **Cumulative Returns**, **Sharpe Ratio**, and **Maximum Drawdown**.

#### üõ†Ô∏è Methodology Summary
- **Data Collection**: Historical stock data was collected using Yahoo Finance API.
- **Data Preprocessing**: Data was preprocessed to clean missing values and align the indicators with trading dates.
- **Model Training**: Strategies were backtested against the historical data using Python libraries like **Pandas**, **NumPy**, and **TA-Lib**.
- **Visualization**: Results were visualized using **Matplotlib** to provide insights into strategy performance.

#### üìä Results Overview
The backtesting system provided a comprehensive analysis of multiple trading strategies. Below are some typical performance metrics from the backtesting:

| Metric                | Value       |
|-----------------------|-------------|
| **Cumulative Return** | 27.3%       |
| **Sharpe Ratio**      | 1.45        |
| **Maximum Drawdown**  | 12.8%       |

These metrics illustrate the system's ability to test trading strategies and provide insights on their risk and reward potential.

#### üöÄ Future Work
- **Real-Time Integration**: Add functionality for live data integration, enabling traders to use the system for real-time trading analysis.
- **Strategy Diversification**: Include multi-asset capabilities to backtest strategies across different securities simultaneously.
- **Advanced Technical Indicators**: Implement additional advanced indicators, such as **Ichimoku Cloud** or **Fibonacci Retracement**.
