This photo shows my focus and love for music, just like my dedication and pursuit of excellence in academic research. I believe that whether it is playing music or academic exploration, concentration and persistence are the key qualities to achieve the goal. This attitude towards details and continuous efforts will also be reflected in my postgraduate study.
